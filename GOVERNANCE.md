# Governance

MoltMine starts as a **benevolent dictator** project to keep velocity high.

## Roles
- **Maintainer**: approves roadmap decisions and merges.
- **Contributors**: propose changes via issues/PRs.

## Decision-making
- Prefer rough consensus.
- Maintain compatibility whenever possible.
- Specs (in `spec/`) are treated as the project’s stable contract.
